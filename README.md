# 🚲 Motional-Bikes

This is an external-api based application. It fetches data from [Bike Index API](https://bikeindex.org/documentation/api_v3#!/selections/GET_version_selections_colors_format_get_0) and [JCDecaux developer API](https://developer.jcdecaux.com/#/home) shows data in a cool way to the user using Framer Motion and Mapbox GL.

### 🎯 Objectives of the project 
---
🚀 Consuming an external data in NextJS application via a custom hook built with [react query library](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query).

🚀 Using the latest **Next Image component** which is introduced in version 10. It has many benefits like **lazy loading** and **image optimisation** etc. 😬

🚀 NextJS's `dynamic import` property is used for code splitting. 🏬

🚀 Using [framer motion library](https://github.com/framer/motion) for scrolling, fading and other cool animations. 🎥

🚀 CSS modules and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. 🌈

🚀 Show all public bike stations on a map by using [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/).
